## Interpolate 1D Array Custom Device ##

**Interpolate 1D Array Custom Device** allows users to import a tab or comma delimited file and use a channel to look up data points in the file.

**Note: This add-on is not recommended for use with hardware channels and NI VeriStand 2012 or later because of the native look up table based scales now available in the system explorer, however model channels are not natively scalable, so there is still use to this add on for model channels.**
